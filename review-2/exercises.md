# Review (HTML/CSS/GIT/RUBY/RAILS)

We have covered a lot of ground so far in this course. Today we'll be building a landing page for your blog, adding your rails app into source control, and touching up your blog. Time permitting, we'll also be going over the solution for the authorization homework using CanCanCan.

## Creating a new controller in Rails for our landing page


## Touching up the blog

Exercise 1:
**The buttons we added have a displeasing font color scheme - this happens after they are clicked once and is a result of the `:visited` pseudo-selector. Your task is to find the CSS that is committing this crime and get rid of it. Hint: it is in the same place as where we got rid of the black box background on `:hover`.**

Exercise 1:
**The alert section above the nav bar has some spacing between it and the nav bar that doesn't look great. How can we get rid of that awkward white space? Hint: inspect the element and see what property is making this happen. You can play around with adjusting various attributes to see what might fix it. The solution is just one line of CSS that overrides some Bootstrap styling.**

Exercise 2:
**Add nice Bootstrap buttons to all the links on your blog's post index. Look at how we made the nav bar buttons for log in / sign up. Bonus: use non-default stying on some of the buttons for added effect.**
