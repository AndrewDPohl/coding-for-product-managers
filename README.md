2. **Lecture-notes.md**: This is what you will go through during the class.
3. **Resources.md**: You will find here additionnal resources if you want to go further than what have been taught during class
4. **Exercises.md**: If you need some more training, you will addtionnal exercises to practice your code and help you memorize the concepts you learn in class
