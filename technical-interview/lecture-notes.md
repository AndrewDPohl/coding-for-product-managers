# Technical Interview

As manager, you might be interested in applying for technical companies. In that case, you have a chance of being confronted to technical questions. That's why today, we will learn about what a technical interview looks like and what you should be prepared to as manager.

## What you will learn today
* What is an engineer technical interview
* What to expect from a technical interview as manager
* Practice one typical exercise: Whiteboard challenge

## Typical engineer interview
A typical On-site interview is around 45 minutes divided in 3 parts. An introduction, a coding challenge and a part where the interviewee can ask questions. We will cover those three parts quickly so that you have a good overview of what an engineer interview looks like.

### Introduction
During the introduction part, you'll have around 5 minutes to introduce yourself and talk about your coding background.

ADD TYPICAL INTRO QUESTIONS

### Coding Challenges
Coding challenges are around 30 minutes. There can be one or several coding problems.


- Can you write code in Java or C++ to find the power set of a given set? For example if S={a,b} the power set is P={{},{a},{b},{a,b}} ( you can also choose any of your favorite programming language)

- Write code in Java to find out whether a binary tree is a mirror image of itself or not. Should code be thread-safe?

- Can you write code to implement your own hashtable in C++ or Java?

- Write code to find out a number of occurrence of a number in a sorted array ?

- Can you implement a Generic LRU Cache in Java ?

- Write a program to solve a Rubik's cube in any programming language.


### Interviewee questions
The final 5 minutes are reserved for the interviewee to ask questions.

## What to expect as manager
As a manager, you won't have questions that are that complicated. However it might happen that your interviewer asks you questions about your technical background and want to verify it.

### Easier technical questions

PUT TYPICAL EXAMPLE QUESTIONS.

MENTION THE FACT THAT THEY MIGHT BE ASKED HOW THEIR TECHNICAL BACKGROUND WILL HELP THEM

### Advice
IF YOU HAVE TECHNICAL CHALLENGE, ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE

## Whiteboard challenge
Let's practice now! We're gonna divide the class into two groups. One group will be handled by your instructor and the other one by your Teaching Assistant.

We will do a mock coding challenge on a whiteboard. You'll be asked questions related to what you've learnt during this program. As a team, you'll be able to help the person that has to write on the whiteboard.

Good Luck!
