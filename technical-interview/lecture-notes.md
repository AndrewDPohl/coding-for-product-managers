# Technical Interview

As manager, you might be interested in applying for technical companies. In that case, you have a chance of being confronted by technical questions. That's why today we will learn about what a technical interview looks like and what you should be prepared for as a manager.

## What you will learn today
* What is an engineer technical interview
* What to expect from a technical interview as a manager
* Practice one typical exercise: Whiteboard challenge

## Typical engineer interview
A typical on-site interview can range from 1-5 hours; but is typically divided into 2 parts. An introduction/cultural fit portion, and the technical portion. The technical portion can be pair programming, an online coding challenge, whiteboarding, architecture overview, high-level conceptual questions, or a live demo and conversation of a project the candidate has previously worked on. We will cover each part so that you have a good overview of what an engineer interview looks like.

### Introduction / Cultural fit
This is an engineers opportunity to demonstrate their soft skills, which many would argue are just as crucial as technical ability. Companies want a team player who knows how to communicate well, and who people enjoy working alongside with. Also, more and more companies (especially startups) look for candidates who are mission driven.

# Coding Challenges
Typically each coding challenge portion in an on-site is between 30 mins to an hour. You may have several technical coding portions. 

### Pair programming
This is when you code alongside your interviewer. In a typical scenerio, there may be a 'driver' and a 'navigator' where the navigator is telling the driver what to code, and the driver is actually typing the code in. In an interview scenerio you most likely wouldn't have this driver-navigator divide, since after all, you are the focal point. However, these are meant to be collaborative, and test the engineers ability to communicate clearly and be a team player. 

### Online coding challenge
Oftentimes the interviewer will share a link to a platform where the candidate will need to solve a challenge online, on a shared screen where the interviewer can see as the candidate is typing code. Oftentimes the candidate will still be able to resort to Google for help with syntax, but might get docked points if they overly rely on googling. Sometimes the coding platforms will not be as nice as your own workspace; Google is notorious for sending candidates a simple google doc with 0 syntax highligthing. 

### Whiteboarding
Did you know that code can also be written on a piece of paper, or even a whiteboard? Whiteboarding challenges are oftentimes the most feared coding challenges, since you have no syntax highlighting, and the environment is much different from your every day routine. Again, this is another opportunity for the interviewer to get a grasp of how well the candidate communicates, and how well her or she understands high level concepts, and how they go about reasoning with a problem. Certain companies have even been known to given candidates a problem with no possible solution, with the objective of seeing how they go about trying to obtain a solution, and to see how they react when they do not find one. Do they keep trying different strategies, or do they break down and start getting frustrated? 

### Architecture Overview
Typically a candidate can best express the architecture of an app through drawing a diagram. The initial question might be "Give me a top level diagram of how you would design an e-commerce platform." From there the candidate is expected to draw a diagram that shows how the client and server interact, along with the database, a cache (if you choose to include one), and any other services or web API integrations. A candidate who truly understands the big picture, can clearly talk through the process as they draw the diagram. 

### Conceptual Questions
What is the difference between Angular and React? In what situations would you use a relational database vs a non-relational database? What is an ORM? What is dirty checking in Angular? The list goes on...

### Live Demo
Each software engineering candidate, or even product manager, should have at least one recent project that they can comfortably give a live demo of. A quick and simple description of what the app or website is, is sufficient; what is more interesting is the conversation around the technologies used (and why those), how you set up the database, and what the biggest technical challenges were. For a product manager, the conversation may revolve more around the product decisions- how did you prioritize what to build first? What is an example of a feature you chose to leave out, and why? How well did the team work together, and how could you remove future roadblocks? 

- Can you write code in Java or C++ to find the power set of a given set? For example if S={a,b} the power set is P={{},{a},{b},{a,b}} ( you can also choose any of your favorite programming language)

- Write code in Java to find out whether a binary tree is a mirror image of itself or not. Should code be thread-safe?

- Can you write code to implement your own hashtable in C++ or Java?

- Write code to find out a number of occurrence of a number in a sorted array ?

- Can you implement a Generic LRU Cache in Java ?

- Write a program to solve a Rubik's cube in any programming language.


### Interviewee questions
The final 5 minutes are reserved for the interviewee to ask questions.

## What to expect as a product manager
As a product manager, you won't have questions that are that technically complicated. However it might happen that your interviewer asks you questions about your technical background and want to verify it.

### Easier technical questions

PUT TYPICAL EXAMPLE QUESTIONS.

MENTION THE FACT THAT THEY MIGHT BE ASKED HOW THEIR TECHNICAL BACKGROUND WILL HELP THEM

### Advice
IF YOU HAVE TECHNICAL CHALLENGE, ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE

## Whiteboard challenge
Let's practice now! We're gonna divide the class into two groups. One group will be handled by your instructor and the other one by your Teaching Assistant.

We will do a mock coding challenge on a whiteboard. You'll be asked questions related to what you've learnt during this program. As a team, you'll be able to help the person that has to write on the whiteboard.

Good Luck!
