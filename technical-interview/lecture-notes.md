## Typical engineer interview
A typical On-site interview is around 45 minutes divided in 3 parts. An introduction, a coding challenge and a part where the interviewee can ask questions. We will cover those three parts quickly so that you have a good overview of what an engineer interview looks like.

### Introduction
During the introduction part, you'll have around 5 minutes to introduce yourself and talk about your coding background.

## Whiteboard challenge
Let's practice now! We're gonna divide the class into two groups. One group will be handled by your instructor and the other one by your Teaching Assistant.

We will do a mock coding challenge on a whiteboard. You'll be asked questions related to what you've learnt during this program. As a team, you'll be able to help the person that has to write on the whiteboard.

Good Luck!
