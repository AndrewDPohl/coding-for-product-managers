# CSS Part 2

Open up our previous Cloud 9 Workspace and finish creating our flex box Blog. Which classes/ids needed to be applied to which elements?

How do we position certain elements in specific places? Let's do some more practice and get you familiar with css positioning.

**go to [CSS Exercises](css_exercises)**

1) Box Positioning

2) Computer Gallery

3) Astronaut

After the exercises, we're going to be remaking our landing page from the HTML section because it's super bare-bones.

### Cross-Browser Compatability
Making sure a site displays properly across different platforms can be a major headache for developers. To mitigate this, we test on multiple devices/browsers and use CSS browser prefixes to add support for CSS features before they are natively supported by the browser.

Prefixes:  
Android: `-webkit-`  
Chrome: `-webkit-`  
Firefox: `-moz-`  
Internet Explorer: `-ms-`  
iOS: `-webkit-`

*Exercise: run your css through the auto-prefixer, save the new CSS and then view in another browser*

#### Head Meta-tags:

Add this to the head of your file to let your mobile browser know your site is optimized for mobile:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
