<!-- create a <div> element and give it a class "box" -->
<!-- duplicate that three times -->
<!-- add an external style sheet and make them all 100 by 100 squares -->
<!-- give them distinct ids and content so we can tell them apart -->
<!-- in our style sheet target each id and give them different background colors -->
<!-- let's see what different POSITION attributes do -->
<!-- how do we get the text centered in each box? -->
<!-- how about vertical centering? -->
<!-- let's make the text its own element so we have better control over it -->
<!-- now let's make the container display: flex -->
<!-- how do we put something in the middle -->
<!-- let's say we're making sticky menu on the top -->
<!-- how can we put all the menu items to one side? -->
<!-- how can we make sure they're not all squished together? -->
