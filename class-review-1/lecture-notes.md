# Course Review : Front-End Development

During this class, we will review together key concepts we learn about the Terminal, HTML and CSS. You will be able to ask questions and clarify some specific points you want to clarify.

## What you will learn in this course
* Review HTML and how to use tags
* Review CSS, selectors, classes, ids
* Review Git and shell commands
* Go further and learn about Sass


## HTML
Explain again what is HTML

Find a harder exercise than in the previous sessions

## CSS
Explain what is CSS again and emphasize on what the instructor thinks they had more difficulties (Selectors)

Find a harder exercise that follows the exercises with HTML

## Git
Show the commands again, explain the difference between Git and Github and how the two are connected.
Also show who are using Github (Docker, Product School etc.)

Make the students commit the exercise to their Github ?

## Going Further: Sass
Explain to Students what is out there and can be useful to them to know. Sass can be useful as it automates CSS for example.
